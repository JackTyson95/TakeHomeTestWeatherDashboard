WEATHER DASHBOARD APP (take home test)


Description 

  This project uses the open weather API to return weather details (temperature, humidit;, wind speed, a weather description and a weather icon). The first key feature is a search component can use the search bar to search for a location which will then return a response with the weather details . There is error handling for both if the input box is empty as well as if the user enters an invalid location. There is a geo location feature that shows under the CurrCard component which shows the users weather data relevant to their location. This displays the same weather details as above. There is alos a CityCards component which shows the weather data from various pre-set cities. 
 I used a vite dev server to make this project in tandem with react so I would not have to reload on every change. I also like the ROI when it comes to components. I used tailwind for ease of using css which were applied per class in my index.css file. I used react router dom for routing, I am not currently aware of any other way to do this.

 I relied on resources like youtube, stack overflow; generative AI, reddit and online education platformds. I basically used every avenue available to me to help me develop my knowledge and skills around this project. I remain vigiliant and keep a critical mind when using all of these resources as I view as tools each with their own limitations.  I am going to implement further features to develop my skills, these would include: animations, weekly forecast data demonstrated in graphs using chart js and possibly dynamic backgrounds. I did have chart.js and an auto complete function but was not happy with the results but these will be my next features. I need to refine my code and get a deeper understanding of JS and the back-end logic so I can widen my scope with projects. I am overall still very happy with the outcome and did what I could within the timeframe.
