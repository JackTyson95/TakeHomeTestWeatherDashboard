#I used a vite dev server to make this project in tandem with react so I would not have to reload on every change. I also like the ROI when it comes to components.
# I used tailwind for CSS and compliled global classes in my index.css file.
#I used react router dom for routing.
#npm's used:
 -npm install react react-dom
 -npm install react-router-dom
 #pip's used:
 -pip install fastapi httpx
